# Role-Based Dashboard System - Implementation Complete

## Overview

## Access Control System

### Route Protection (`ProtectedRoute.jsx`)
A new component that enforces role-based access:
```javascript
<ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['Admin', 'Manager']}>
  <Approvals />
</ProtectedRoute>
```

### Route Permissions (`App.jsx`)
- **All Roles:** Dashboard, Expenses, Create Expense
- **Admin + Manager:** Approvals
- **Admin Only:** Users, Approval Rules, Company

### Navigation Filtering (`Layout.jsx`)
The sidebar automatically filters menu items based on user role:
- **Employee sees:** Dashboard, Expenses
- **Manager sees:** Dashboard, Expenses, Approvals
- **Admin sees:** Dashboard, Expenses, Approvals, Approval Rules, Users, Company

## How It Works

### 1. User Login
When a user logs in, their role (Admin/Manager/Employee) is stored in the auth state.

### 2. Dashboard Routing (`Dashboard.jsx`)
The main Dashboard component acts as a router:
```javascript
switch (user?.role) {
  case 'Admin':
    return <AdminDashboard />;
  case 'Manager':
    return <ManagerDashboard />;
  case 'Employee':
    return <EmployeeDashboard />;
}
```

### 3. Navigation Protection
- Layout.jsx filters sidebar items based on `item.roles.includes(user?.role)`
- User only sees menu items they're authorized to access

### 4. Route Guards
- ProtectedRoute component checks `allowedRoles` array
- Unauthorized users are redirected to their dashboard
- Prevents URL manipulation to access restricted pages

## Benefits

### Complete Separation
- Each role has a dedicated dashboard tailored to their needs
- No clutter from features they can't use
- Clear visual distinction (color themes)

### Security
- Role-based route guards prevent unauthorized access
- Backend validates all requests (double security)
- Navigation hides inaccessible pages

### User Experience
- Role-appropriate information at a glance
- Quick actions relevant to their job function
- No confusion about what they can/cannot do

### Maintainability
- Each dashboard is a separate component
- Easy to modify role-specific features
- Clear separation of concerns in code

## Testing the System

### As Admin:
1. Login with admin credentials
2. See purple-themed AdminDashboard with system statistics
3. Sidebar shows: Dashboard, Expenses, Approvals, Approval Rules, Users, Company
4. Can access all pages

### As Manager:
1. Login with manager credentials
2. See blue-themed ManagerDashboard with team oversight
3. Sidebar shows: Dashboard, Expenses, Approvals
4. Cannot access Users, Approval Rules, or Company pages
5. If they try to manually navigate to /users, they're redirected to /dashboard

### As Employee:
1. Login with employee credentials
2. See green-themed EmployeeDashboard with personal expenses
3. Sidebar shows: Dashboard, Expenses
4. Cannot access Approvals, Users, Approval Rules, or Company pages
5. Redirected to dashboard if attempting unauthorized access

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
1. `frontend/src/pages/dashboards/AdminDashboard.jsx` - Admin-specific dashboard
2. `frontend/src/pages/dashboards/ManagerDashboard.jsx` - Manager-specific dashboard
3. `frontend/src/pages/dashboards/EmployeeDashboard.jsx` - Employee-specific dashboard
4. `frontend/src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx` - Role-based route guard component

### Modified:
1. `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` - Now routes to role-specific dashboards
2. `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Added route protection and missing routes (Users, Approval Rules, Company)

### Existing (Already Correct):
1. `frontend/src/components/Layout.jsx` - Already had role-based navigation filtering
2. `frontend/src/store/authStore.js` - Manages user authentication and role

## Next Steps

The role-based system is now complete. You can:
1. Test each role's dashboard and navigation
2. Verify that unauthorized access is blocked
3. Customize each dashboard further based on specific business needs
4. Add more role-specific features as required
